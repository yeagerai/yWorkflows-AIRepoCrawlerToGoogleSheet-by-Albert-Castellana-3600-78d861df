# AIRepoCrawlerToGoogleSheet Documentation

## 1. Component Name

AIRepoCrawlerToGoogleSheet

## 2. Description

AIRepoCrawlerToGoogleSheet is a Yeager component that searches for specific keywords, extracts the search results and stores them in a Google Sheet. It is based on `AbstractWorkflow`, which provides base methods and properties for Yeager components.

## 3. Input and Output Models

### Input Model: SearchKeywordsIn

This input model has one attribute:

- `keywords`: A list of strings, representing keywords to be searched

### Output Model: SearchResultsOut

This output model has two attributes:

- `results`: A list of dictionaries containing search results
- `spreadsheet_url`: A string representing the URL of the Google Sheet where the search results are stored

## 4. Parameters

The primary method of the component, `transform()`, requires two parameters:

- `args`: An instance of `SearchKeywordsIn` containing the input keywords
- `callbacks`: Currently, this parameter is not used and set to `None`

## 5. Transform Function

The `transform()` method performs the following steps:

1. It calls the `transform()` method of the superclass with `args` and `callbacks` as parameters.
2. It extracts the search results and the spreadsheet URL from the dictionary returned by the superclass.
3. It creates an instance of `SearchResultsOut` with the extracted search results and spreadsheet URL.
4. It returns the instance of `SearchResultsOut`.

## 6. External Dependencies

The component relies on the following external libraries:

- `typing`: Provides functions to construct complex types
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file
- `fastapi`: Provides tools to create a web API using Python
- `pydantic`: Provides BaseModel class for data validation and serialization

## 7. API Calls

No external API calls are made directly by this component. However, the superclass that it inherits may make API calls to implement the component's functionality.

## 8. Error Handling

This component does not have any specific error handling, as errors are propagated to the caller. However, Pydantic can raise validation errors if the input model does not match the expected data types or requirements.

## 9. Examples

Here is an example of how to use this component within a Yeager Workflow:
